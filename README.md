# Ollama Agent

Ollama Agent is a powerful command-line tool (CLI and REPL) that allows you to interact with local AI models. Built on [DeepAgents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) and [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), it provides a persistent chat experience, session management, and the ability to execute local shell commands, turning your local models into helpful assistants for your daily tasks.

## Features

- **Interactive REPL**: A modern, terminal-based chat interface with Markdown rendering and slash commands.
- **Non-Interactive CLI**: Execute single prompts directly from your command line for quick queries.
- **Native Ollama Integration**: Connects directly to Ollama's native API (via `langchain-ollama`), no OpenAI compatibility layer needed.
- **Thinking / Reasoning**: Leverages Ollama's native [thinking capability](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/thinking) to expose model reasoning traces. Configurable per model via `--effort`.
- **Automatic Context Window**: Resolves the model's effective context window (`num_ctx`) automatically from Ollama metadata, or allows manual override in config.
- **Per-session Model Switching**: Change the model mid-conversation and continue from that point with the new model (context preserved). The change is not permanent and only affects the current session.
- **Screen Vision (Screenshots)**: Attach monitor screenshots in prompts using `@dpN` for visual context.
- **Tool-Powered**: The agent can execute shell commands via an integrated shell backend, allowing it to interact with your local environment to perform tasks.
- **Delegated MCP Agents**: Each configured MCP server can run through its own lightweight DeepAgents sub-agent (via `langchain-mcp-adapters`) with custom model and instructions.
- **Session Management**: Conversations are automatically saved and can be reloaded, deleted, or switched between.
- **Task Management**: Save frequently used prompts as "tasks" and execute them with a simple command.
- **Configurable**: Easily configure the model, Ollama host, context window, and reasoning effort.
- **Mem0 Memory Layer**: Persistent memory backed by Mem0 + Qdrant, exposed through function-calling tools.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Create and manage document databases for context-aware responses using local embeddings and Qdrant.
- **Skills**: Extend the agent with reusable, on-demand capabilities via the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Skills provide task-specific instructions and context through progressive disclosure.

## Prerequisites (Important)

Before installing/running the app, make sure you have:

- **Ollama (or compatible API) running**.
- **A model that supports tool calling** (required). If the selected model does not support tools/function-calling, the app will exit.
- **The embeddings model downloaded in Ollama**. By default, Mem0 and RAG use `nomic-embed-text:latest`.
- **Vision-capable model (optional)**: only required if you want to use Screen Vision (`@dpN`). If your model does not support vision, the app will still work but it won't be able to "see" screenshots.

```bash
# Required embeddings model (default for Mem0 and RAG)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest
```

## Installation

For end-users, the recommended way to install `ollama-agent` is using `pipx`, which installs the application in an isolated environment.

```bash
# Install from GitHub
pipx install git+https://github.com/arrase/ollama-agent.git
```

## Quick Start

Start the interactive REPL:

```bash
ollama-agent
```

Or run a single prompt (non-interactive):

```bash
ollama-agent -p "List all files in the current directory as JSON."
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (REPL)

To start the chat interface, simply run:

```bash
ollama-agent
```

The REPL provides a persistent chat session. You can use slash commands to manage the session:

- `/help`: Show available commands.
- `/new`: Start a new chat session (clears context).
- `/clear`: Clear the screen.
- `/models`: List available Ollama models (shows tool support).
- `/model-set <model>`: Switch to a different model (conversation preserved).
- `/sessions`: List saved sessions.
- `/session-load <id>`: Load a saved session.
- `/session-delete <id>`: Delete a saved session.
- `/tasks`: List saved tasks.
- `/task-run <id>`: Run a specific task.
- `/task-delete <id>`: Delete a specific task.
- `/task-create <id>`: Create a task interactively.
- `/rag`: Show current RAG database status.
- `/rag-list`: List available RAG databases.
- `/rag-create <name>`: Create a new RAG database.
- `/rag-load <name>`: Load a RAG database for the session.
- `/rag-unload`: Unload the current RAG database.
- `/rag-add <path>`: Add a file to the loaded RAG database.
- `/rag-add <path> --dir`: Add all files from a directory.
- `/rag-delete <name>`: Delete a RAG database.
- `/skills`: List all skills.
- `/skill-show <id>`: Show skill details.
- `/skill-create <id>`: Create a skill interactively.
- `/skill-delete <id>`: Delete a skill.
- `/mcps`: List MCP server connection status and tool counts.
- `/mcps <name>`: Show tools available on a specific MCP server.
- `/exit`: Quit the application.

### Non-Interactive Mode

You can run a single prompt directly from the command line:

```bash
ollama-agent --prompt "List all files in the current directory as JSON."
# Or using the short form:
ollama-agent -p "List all files in the current directory as JSON."
```

### Screen Vision (Screenshots)

Screen vision is not limited to a specific mode: it works anywhere you can type a prompt (both REPL and CLI).

Attach a screenshot of a monitor as context by including `@dpN` in your prompt (`N` is a 0-based monitor index):

```bash
ollama-agent -p "Describe what you see in @dp0"
```

If you include multiple tokens (e.g. `@dp0 @dp1`), the agent will capture and attach each requested monitor.

### Common Options

You can override the configured model, reasoning effort, or tool execution timeout:

```bash
ollama-agent --model "gpt-oss:20b" --effort "high" --prompt "What is the current date?"
# Or using short forms:
ollama-agent -m "gpt-oss:20b" -e "high" -p "What is the current date?"
```

**Thinking / Reasoning effort** — the `--effort` flag maps to Ollama's native [`think` parameter](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/thinking). Thinking-capable models emit a `thinking` field that separates their reasoning trace from the final answer.

| Model family | `--effort` value | Ollama `think` value | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GPT-OSS** | `low` / `medium` / `high` | `"low"` / `"medium"` / `"high"` | Sets the thinking trace length. GPT-OSS only accepts these levels; `true`/`false` is ignored. |
| **GPT-OSS** | `disabled` | *(not sent)* | GPT-OSS cannot fully disable thinking — a warning is emitted and the model uses its default behaviour. |
| **Other thinking models** (Qwen 3, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek-v3.1, …) | any except `disabled` | `true` | Enables thinking. |
| **Other thinking models** | `disabled` | `false` | Disables thinking. |
| **Non-thinking models** | *(any)* | *(not sent)* | Setting is ignored. |

Thinking is enabled by default in Ollama for supported models. See the [Ollama thinking docs](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/thinking) for the full list of supported models and API details.

```bash
ollama-agent --builtin-tool-timeout 60 --prompt "Run a long-running task"
# Or using short forms:
ollama-agent -t 60 -p "Run a long-running task"
```

**Available Parameters:**

- `-m`, `--model`: Specify the AI model to use
- `-p`, `--prompt`: Provide a prompt for non-interactive mode
- `-e`, `--effort`: Set reasoning effort level (low, medium, high, disabled)
- `-t`, `--builtin-tool-timeout`: Set tool-call timeout in seconds (applies to tool executions, including shell backend and built-in tools). Overrides `builtin_tool_timeout` from `config.ini` for the current run.
- `--rag <database>`: Load a RAG database for the session
- `--skills-dir <dir>`: Additional skills directory (can be repeated to add multiple sources)
- `--config-reset <option>`: Reset configuration to defaults (`all`, `system-prompt`, or `config-file`)

## Tasks

Tasks are saved prompts that can be executed repeatedly.

**Create a Task (CLI):**

```bash
ollama-agent task-create <task_id> \
    --title "My task title" \
    --task-prompt "Do the thing" \
    --task-model "gpt-oss:20b" \
    --task-effort "medium"
```

- Use `--force` to overwrite an existing task.
- `task_id` must be filesystem-safe (letters, numbers, `_`, `-`).

**Create a Task (REPL):**

Inside the REPL:

```text
/task-create <task_id>
```

The REPL will prompt you for title/model/effort and then lets you enter a **multiline** prompt (finish with Esc+Enter).

**Create a Task (manual YAML):**

Tasks are stored as YAML files in `~/.ollama-agent/tasks/`. To create one, add a new file named `<task_id>.yaml` in that directory.

- `<task_id>` can be any filesystem-safe ID (it will show up in `task-list` and is what you pass to `task-run`).
- The YAML supports: `title`, `prompt`, `model`, and (optionally) `reasoning_effort`.

Example:

```yaml
title: "List repo tree"
prompt: "List all files in this repository as a tree."
model: "gpt-oss:20b"
reasoning_effort: "medium"  # low|medium|high|disabled
```

**List Tasks:**

```bash
ollama-agent task-list
# or inside REPL: /tasks
```

**Run a Task:**

Use the task ID (or a unique prefix) from the list to run it.

```bash
ollama-agent task-run <task_id>
# or inside REPL: /task-run <task_id>
```

**Delete a Task:**

```bash
ollama-agent task-delete <task_id>
# or inside REPL: /task-delete <task_id>
```

## Configuration

On the first run, the application will create a default configuration file at `~/.ollama-agent/config.ini`. You can edit this file to permanently change the default model, Ollama host, and other settings.

Example default section:

```ini
[default]
model = qwen3.5:9b
base_url = http://localhost:11434
reasoning_effort = medium
context_window =
```

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `model` | Default Ollama model. Must support tool calling. |
| `base_url` | Native Ollama host (e.g. `http://localhost:11434`). Must **not** contain an `/v1` path — if detected, the app will exit with an error asking you to update the value. |
| `reasoning_effort` | Default thinking level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `disabled`. See [Thinking / Reasoning](#common-options) above. |
| `context_window` | If set, forces the runtime `num_ctx` for the selected model. Leave empty to let the app resolve it automatically (see below). |

### Context Window Resolution

Ollama Agent needs to know the effective context window (`num_ctx`) for every model. The runtime resolves it in this order:

1. `context_window` from `config.ini`, if defined.
2. `PARAMETER num_ctx` from `ollama show <model>` (the model's Modelfile).
3. The model's reported `*.context_length` metadata from `ollama show <model>`.

If none of those sources provides a value, the app exits with a clear error asking you to set `context_window` in `config.ini`.

### Configuration Reset

If you need to reset the configuration or system prompt to their default values, you can use the `--config-reset` flag:

```bash
# Reset all configuration files
ollama-agent --config-reset all

# Reset only the system prompt (instructions.md)
ollama-agent --config-reset system-prompt

# Reset only the settings (config.ini)
ollama-agent --config-reset config-file
```

> **Note**: When upgrading from v0.1 to v0.2, it is recommended to reset the system prompt to ensure compatibility with new features:
> `ollama-agent --config-reset system-prompt`

## Persistent Memory with Mem0

The agent can remember long-term facts by delegating storage and retrieval to [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) running locally, backed by embedded/local Qdrant storage.

### Configure Mem0 storage path

In `~/.ollama-agent/config.ini` under `[mem0]`:

```ini
[mem0]
qdrant_path= ~/.ollama-agent/memory
```

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

RAG allows the agent to search through your documents and use relevant context when answering questions. Documents are chunked, embedded using Ollama, and stored in local Qdrant databases.

### RAG Databases

RAG databases are stored in `~/.ollama-agent/rag/<name>/`. Each database is independent and can contain documents from different sources.

**Create a Database (CLI):**

```bash
ollama-agent rag-create my-docs
```

**Create a Database (REPL):**

```text
/rag-create my-docs
```

**List Databases:**

```bash
ollama-agent rag-list
# or inside REPL: /rag-list
```

**Delete a Database:**

```bash
ollama-agent rag-delete my-docs
# or inside REPL: /rag-delete my-docs
```

### Adding Documents

Before adding documents, you need to load a database (in REPL) or specify it in the command (CLI).

**Add a Single File (CLI):**

```bash
ollama-agent rag-add my-docs /path/to/document.md
```

**Add a Directory (CLI):**

```bash
ollama-agent rag-add my-docs /path/to/folder --dir
```

**Add Files (REPL):**

First load the database, then add files:

```text
/rag-load my-docs
/rag-add /path/to/document.md
/rag-add /path/to/folder --dir
```

Supported file types include: `.txt`, `.md`, `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.html`, `.css`, `.xml`, `.csv`, `.rst`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, `.sh`

### Searching Documents

Manual query commands have been removed from both CLI and REPL. Load a RAG database and ask your question normally — the agent will use the `rag_search` tool automatically when it needs document context.

### Using RAG with Prompts

Once a RAG database is loaded, the agent can automatically search it using the `rag_search` tool, which returns both formatted context and detailed results with relevance scores.

**Start REPL with RAG:**

```bash
ollama-agent --rag my-docs
```

**Use RAG in Non-Interactive Mode:**

```bash
ollama-agent --rag my-docs -p "What does the documentation say about configuration?"
```

**Switch RAG Database (REPL):**

```text
/rag-load another-db
```

### Configure RAG

In `~/.ollama-agent/config.ini` under `[rag]`:

```ini
[rag]
rag_dir = ~/.ollama-agent/rag
embedder_model = nomic-embed-text:latest
embedder_base_url = http://localhost:11434
embedding_dims = 768
default_top_k = 5
chunk_size = 500
chunk_overlap = 50
```

- `rag_dir`: Directory where RAG databases are stored
- `embedder_model`: Ollama model used for generating embeddings
- `embedding_dims`: Dimension of the embedding vectors (must match the model)
- `default_top_k`: Default number of results to return in searches
- `chunk_size`: Maximum size of text chunks (in characters)
- `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between consecutive chunks

## Skills

Skills are reusable agent capabilities that provide specialized workflows and domain knowledge. They follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and are powered by [DeepAgents skills](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/skills).

When a prompt arrives, the agent checks skill descriptions to find relevant ones. Only when a skill matches does the agent read the full instructions — this pattern is called *progressive disclosure* and keeps the system prompt lean.

### Skill Structure

Each skill is a directory containing at least a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```text
~/.ollama-agent/skills/
├── langgraph-docs/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── arxiv-search/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── arxiv_search.py
```

Example `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: langgraph-docs
description: Use this skill for requests related to LangGraph in order to fetch relevant documentation to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.
---

# langgraph-docs

## Overview

This skill explains how to access LangGraph Python documentation.

## Instructions

1. Fetch the documentation index using the fetch_url tool.
2. Select 2-4 most relevant documentation URLs.
3. Fetch selected documentation.
4. Provide accurate guidance based on the docs.
```

Additional files (scripts, templates, docs) can be placed alongside `SKILL.md` — just reference them in the instructions so the agent knows when and how to use them.

### Skill Sources and Precedence

Skills are loaded from multiple directories in order (last wins for same-name skills):

1. **Global**: `~/.ollama-agent/skills/` — user-level skills available in every session.
2. **Project**: `./skills/` — project-specific skills in the current working directory.
3. **CLI extra**: directories passed via `--skills-dir`.

```bash
# Load additional skill sources
ollama-agent --skills-dir /path/to/team-skills --skills-dir /path/to/project-skills -p "Help me with LangGraph"
```

### Managing Skills (CLI)

**Create a Skill:**

```bash
ollama-agent skill-create langgraph-docs \
    --name "LangGraph Docs" \
    --description "Fetch relevant LangGraph documentation" \
    --instructions "Use fetch_url to read https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt and select relevant pages."
```

Use `--force` to overwrite an existing skill.

**List Skills:**

```bash
ollama-agent skill-list
# or inside REPL: /skills
```

**Show Skill Details:**

```bash
ollama-agent skill-show langgraph-docs
# or inside REPL: /skill-show langgraph-docs
```

**Delete a Skill:**

```bash
ollama-agent skill-delete langgraph-docs
# or inside REPL: /skill-delete langgraph-docs
```

### Managing Skills (REPL)

Inside the REPL you can create skills interactively:

```text
/skill-create my-skill
```

The REPL will prompt for name, description, and then open a multiline editor for instructions (finish with Esc+Enter).

### Creating Skills Manually

You can also create skills by hand — just create a directory under `~/.ollama-agent/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ollama-agent/skills/my-skill
cat > ~/.ollama-agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-skill
description: A custom skill that does something useful.
---

# my-skill

## Instructions

Your instructions here.
EOF
```

### Tips

- Write clear, specific descriptions — the agent decides whether to use a skill based on the description alone.
- `SKILL.md` files must be under 10 MB; larger files are skipped.
- Descriptions longer than 1024 characters are truncated.
- Skills directories that don't exist are silently ignored.

## Agent Instructions

You can customize the agent's behavior by editing the instructions file at `~/.ollama-agent/instructions.md`. This file is automatically created on first use with default instructions.

## MCP Servers (Optional)

Ollama Agent supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to extend the agent's capabilities with additional tools and context. Each configured MCP server is registered as a native Deep Agents subagent (not as a wrapper tool), using `langchain-mcp-adapters` to load server tools. MCP servers are **optional** and can provide features like filesystem access, Git operations, and custom APIs.

### MCP Configuration

MCP servers are loaded from `~/.ollama-agent/mcp_servers.json` with this shape:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tavily": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
            "agent": {
                "name": "web-research",
                "description": "Researches web topics using Tavily MCP tools.",
                "system_prompt": "You are a web research specialist. Use Tavily tools and return concise findings with links.",
                "model": "gpt-oss:20b"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`agent.name` and `agent.description` are required. `agent.system_prompt` is recommended (falls back to a default MCP prompt if omitted). `agent.model` is optional and overrides the main model for that subagent.
